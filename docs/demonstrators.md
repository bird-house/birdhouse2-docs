## Projects and Demostrators

The birdhouse
`framework is modular organized <framework_structure>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to enable a flexible architecture design depending on the
projects needs. Due to the OCG Standard, software components
non-birdhouse components can be combined for interoperability. Here are
some examples of real projects to show the flexibility and potential of
the birdhouse framework.

## COPERNICUS

-   CP4CDS: Climate Projects for the [Climate Data
    Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/) (part of the European
    Union\'s [Copernicus Climate Change
    Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu/)).


## PAVICS

-   [PAVICS](https://ouranosinc.github.io/pavics-sdi/): Platform for
    climate analysis and visualization by
    [Ouranos](https://www.ouranos.ca/) and
    [CRIM](https://www.crim.ca/en), Canada.
-   [PAVICS-Hydro](https://medium.com/birdhouse-newsletter/web-processing-services-for-hydrological-modeling-7b5eb5c426ed)
    : Additional services for
    [PAVICS](https://ouranosinc.github.io/pavics-sdi/) allowing users to
    perform hydrological modeling and analysis.

## DACCS
-   [DACCS](https://daccs.ca/): *Data Analytics for Canadian Climate
    Services* is a collaboration between the [University of
    Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), the Pacific Climate Impacts
    Consortium ([PCIC](https://www.pacificclimate.org/)), the Computer
    Research Institute of Montr√©al ([CRIM](https://www.crim.ca/en)), and
    [Ouranos](https://www.ouranos.ca/).

    This project evolved from
    [PAVICS](https://ouranosinc.github.io/pavics-sdi/) developments, by
    extending [Birdhouse]() services with multiple new capabilities, and
    providing an *Infrastructure as Code* (IaC) [birdhouse-deploy]()
    definition allowing the customizable selection of server
    [components](https://birdhouse-deploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#birdhouse).
